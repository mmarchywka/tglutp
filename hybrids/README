This set of programs uses both the glutp project
( the molecule and data viewer stuff ) as well as
the "annotate"( string procssoor, AFFX project ).

The glutp program contained some pdb reading classes
but the AFFX command handler and other stuff was
much better suited to these pdf manipulation tasks.
