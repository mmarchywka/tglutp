> Indeed, the structural similarity of dehydrosqualene synthase (PDB codes: 2zco, 2zcp, 2zcq, 2zcr, 2czs) 
and humane squalene synthase (PDB codes 1ezf) is striking in the view of their low sequence identity. TopMatch-web yields an RMS of 3.5A and a sequence identity of 11% if the respective chains A are compared.
