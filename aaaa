    Usage: stats_test
     Generate various survival curves.
     This is monte carlo code designed to do brute force simulation of various
     clinical trial scenarios. It was written specifically to examine a trial
     from Dendreon, but I have generalized it somewhat and used it to test the
     related program 'streaming_data' that can visualize data generated in real time.
     It is designed to be simplistic and adpatable by source code additions and not
     to be completely general for user in current form. 
     Note that, unfortunately, this cmd parser doesn't report errors, use this to check:
     -DEBUG : turn on cmd parse diagnostics for subsequent parameter reads  
    -n1 N : number in group 1  
    -n2 N : number in group 2  
    -m1 N : slope of group 1  
    -m2 N : slope for group 2  
    -events N: limit statistic to first N events  
    -disp_interval N : trials per display ( which can be slow)  
    -ok_limit N : threshold on test statistic
